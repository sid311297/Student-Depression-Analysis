# Student-Depression-Analysis

This project uses data science and machine learning techniques to analyze depression levels in students based on survey responses.

# Objective

To identify key factors contributing to student depression and use machine learning models to predict risk levels. The goal is to support early identification and intervention.

# Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook


# Dataset

The dataset includes survey responses related to academic pressure, social life, sleep patterns, and mental health symptoms. (Dataset source: Add your source here if it's public or created by you.)

# Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


3. Feature Selection


4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)


5. Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix)



# Results

Random Forest achieved 85% accuracy in predicting depression risk.

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models also performed well, providing useful insights into key contributing features.


# Future Improvements

Use deep learning models for improved predictions

Collect more diverse and larger datasets

Build a web application using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions
